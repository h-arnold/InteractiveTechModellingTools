# Interactive Teaching Tools

This repository contains links to all of the interactive modelling tools I've created to help students explore and interact with various concepts.

Almost all of these tools were vibe-coded using Google Gemini and so the code quality will probably be iffy. [I do write nice code when I write it myself, promise!](https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot)
